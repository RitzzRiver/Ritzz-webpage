                    <p>Heyaaaaa~</p>
                    <p>
                        My name is Kris, better known as Ritzz. I'm a 20 years old colombian artist
                        who likes nature and fantasy. I am inspirated by the emotions and indie
                        games.
                    </p>
                    <p>My journey?</p>
                    <p>
                        I started in 2018 with a close friend who also draws a lot. And it awaked me
                        the sensation of materialize or almost give a visual concept of a existent
                        idea, also because I looks great to transform the reality at your desire
                        haha. So I decided to make it a hobby, but it was in 2020 in quarentine with
                        a teacher who doesnt put much effort in art, so there is the second reason
                        to choose arts: the way to express yourself with a image. and finally, on
                        2021 a real teacher of arts gives me the help to grow as an artist with how
                        to draw (at least with the basics) and the history what is a really
                        marvelous thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2022 I went to a Fine Arts school to learn more but... It wasn't that I
                        was specting because all the topics where given in a short time and I don't
                        feel good with only know the basics. If I want to get good at art I need to
                        have good bases. unfortunately, the career of Arts isn't here in my city BUT
                        hey I'm waiting to travel and purse that career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently I have a few bases about color, history, painting, etc. So I can
                        do basic stuff with it, I try to do my best with grow with art, at least
                        watching videos or drawing small sketches for me or my friends
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am too way reserved with strangers, so please be patient with me :3 And
                        yes, if you where asking:
